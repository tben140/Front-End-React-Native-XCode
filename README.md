# Northcoders Final Project Frontend

This repo is the frontend repo for the Saviar Northcoders project group. The application that we built is a running app that will create a running route for the user, avoiding the most heavily polluted local areas. This frontend repo contains the source code necessary to create ios and Android apps with React Native.
